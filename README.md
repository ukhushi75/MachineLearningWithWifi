In this project, I used **Python** and various machine learning models to detect human activity from CSI packet data.

Activities detected include:
- Lie down (1)
- Fall (2)
- Walk (3)
- Pick up (4)
- Run (5)
- Sit down (6)
- Stand up (7)

### Goal  
To recognize different human movements based on signal data and evaluate classifier accuracy and performance.

### Models Implemented
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with different `k` values
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with default parameters
- **Random Forest** with 5, 10, and 20 estimators

### Results  
Each model's output was evaluated using classification accuracy and normalized confusion matrices to understand misclassifications.
